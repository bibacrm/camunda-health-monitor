## ☕ Support Development (100% Voluntary)

This software is **completely free and open source**. No restrictions, no limits, no catch.

However, if it saves your team time and headaches, consider buying us a coffee! ☕

|------------|--------------------------|------|
| 🧪 **1-2 nodes** (dev/test) | **Free - Enjoy!** | You're learning/testing - on us! ☕ |
| 🏢 **3-5 nodes** (small production) | **$10-15/month** | About 2-3 coffees |
| 🏭 **6-9 nodes** (medium production) | **$15-30/month** | About 0.5 coffee per node |

## ❓ Common Questions

### Can I really use this completely free?

**Yes!** Apache 2.0 means completely free for any use - personal, commercial, educational, non-profit, for-profit - everything. No strings attached.

### What if I can't afford to contribute?

**Use it freely!** We built this to help the Camunda community. No guilt, no pressure. Contributions from those who can afford it help us keep developing, but everyone deserves good monitoring tools.

### Our company wants to support. How should we pay?

Thank you! A few options:

### We're using this in production at a large company (e.g., Fortune 500). Should we pay?

You're not *required* to (Apache 2.0 = truly free), but we'd be grateful if you:

- Tell your Camunda-using colleagues about it!

Your support helps us maintain and improve the tool for everyone.
